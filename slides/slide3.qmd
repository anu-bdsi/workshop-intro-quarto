## A Robust, Reproducible Workflow

::: incremental

- Using a robust, reproducible workflow means:
  - you avoid manual, repetitive tasks
  - your results are computationally reproducible 
- Using a robust, reproducible workflow doesn't mean you won't make mistakes, but it will help you minimise mistakes.
- **Literate programming** is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth where it emphasises writing code _for humans_ (i.e. intertwine code with natural language explanations).
- Literate programming includes **documentation** (detailed explanations, comments and annotations to provide context, rationale and insight into the program's design and functionality).

## Statistical Value Chain


> ... a **statistical value chain** is constructed by defining a number of meaningful intermediate data products, for which a chosen set of quality attributes are well described ...

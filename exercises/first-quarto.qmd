## Quarto

**Quarto** enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can also run code in other languages, like Python and Julia. If you have Python or Julia then you can run the following code chunks by changing "eval: false" to "eval: true".

```{python}
#| eval: false
2 * 2
```

```{julia}
#| eval: false
3 * 3
```
